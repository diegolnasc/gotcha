## We Develop and growth with Github
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Prefer write the commits using [Convetional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
3. If you've added a doc or example, make it understandable and clear.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0 January 2004](https://github.com/diegolnasc/gotcha/blob/main/LICENSE/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/diegolnasc/gotcha/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/diegolnasc/gotcha/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background and sample
[This is an example](https://github.com/stevemao/github-issue-templates/blob/master/bugs-only/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) of a bug report.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a consistent coding style

Choose the standart coding style based on the language, framework or file, that you will submit
